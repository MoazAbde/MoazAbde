About Me

I'm a Graduate Electrical Engineering student from the University of Alberta.

Currently, I am looking for a full time job in software development. 
I am eager to apply what I learned into real life problems.

In my free time, I enjoy playing sports competitively (soccer and golf), hanging out with friends, and traveling the world!
