About Me

I'm a second year student at the University of Alberta pursuing a Bachelor of Applied Science in Computer Engineering Software option degree.

Currently, I am looking for summer 2022 Engineering internships. 
I am eager to apply what I learned into real life problems.

In my free time, I enjoy playing sports competitively (soccer and golf), hanging out with friends, and traveling the world! 
I'm studying Engineering at the University of Alberta with an interest in Software and Electrical Engineering.
